# Pure CSS select styling

<img src="pure-css-select-style.png" alt="">

CSS styling of select component without JS, and using inline SVGs for the arrow symbol. The idea is to get rid of the need of using JS / JQuery for a decent `select` styling. Using inline SVG files to avoid extra requests to the server and a good visualization quality in retina displays. The `select` component is thought to be **responsive by default**.

The base of the idea is to remove all the default styling on the select and use a wrapping `div` to add out custom styling.

## Usage
The easiest way of control your `<select>` size is using the `padding` property at `.theme-your-theme select` selector. Other customizations (font, size, color...) are made using standard CSS properties.

Please, take a look to the [**included demo**](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/carloscabo/pure-css-select-style/blob/master/index.html) for several samples.
